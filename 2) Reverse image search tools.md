- yandex.com/images ― powerful facial matching, often returns social media profiles and less-indexed websites  

- bing.com/images ― locate similar face images and linked web pages for cross-verification

## Techniques

- Crop the image to focus only on the face before searching  
- Run the same image across multiple engines (results vary significantly)  
- Look for repeated usernames, bios, or background elements  
- Cross-reference image results with social networks and public records  
- Combine image results with name, location, or employer keywords
